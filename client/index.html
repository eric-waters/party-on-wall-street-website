                We are a team of technically gifted ASU students living an entrepreneurial lifestyle 
                and searching for a way to share that with other students like ourselves. We are avid 
                supporters of personally directed business ventures and self-led projects, and as creators 
                of our own destinies, we wanted to share that experience with others who have a passion for 
                the self-made mindset. Our brandâ€™s goal is to provide a fun and relaxing experience that brings 
                together individuals who share that drive, and to challenge each one of them and their ability to 
                come up with unique and creative solutions on the fly. Our team is focused on providing an experience 
                that resembles the entrepreneurial process while also participating in that same very process: a game 
                for the players, made by the players.

                Party on Wall Street is a couch-party style game where a single host who owns the game can display it on a larger screen 
                for other players to view. These other players can then connecting using their own computer or mobile device in order 
                to interact with the game. During the game, the players will:
                <ol>
                    <li>Invent solutions to randomly-generated problems</li>
                    <li>Choose an invention created by another player</li>
                    <li>Craft an enticing and persuasive pitch for their selected product</li>
                    <li>See their product pitches face-off against other players and vote on their favorite</li>
                    <li>Invest in products that have the most potential</li>
                    <li>Reap rewards in ROI from smart investments</li>

            <h2 class="text-primary"><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>
            <p class="text-light">
                Development is underway! The game is being created using the Unity game engine. We are also utilizing AirConsole in order to use phones as controllers. 
                We have also hired a graphic designer to add art and characters to the game's interface. The implementation is indeed challenging and time consuming, but 
                the game will be complete by April 15, 2022.

            <p class="text-light">
                Using AirConsole technologies to build this game means that we are required to post our game on AirConsole's game store. Although this is not ideal for our own profit, 
                it is the only way the game will be completed in time. After April 15, we intend to remove the AirConsole technology in order to sell the game on its own in popular 
                game stores like Playstation, Xbox, Steam, and more.
                As a brand new game studio, effective advertising will be essential to bringing this game to life. Our marketing strategy is still 
                to be determined, but we anticipate that digital marketing, especially social media marketing, will be the most cost-effective way to 
                reach our target market.
