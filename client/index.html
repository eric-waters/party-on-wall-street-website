                    To provide a refreshing and exciting new experience for the tycoons

                <p>
                    We are a team of technically gifted ASU students living an entrepreneurial lifestyle 
                    and searching for a way to share that with other students like ourselves. We are avid 
                    supporters of personally directed business ventures and self-led projects, and as creators 
                    of our own destinies, we wanted to share that experience with others who have a passion for 
                    the self-made mindset. Our brandâ€™s goal is to provide a fun and relaxing experience that brings 
                    together individuals who share that drive, and to challenge each one of them and their ability to 
                    come up with unique and creative solutions on the fly. Our team is focused on providing an experience 
                    that resembles the entrepreneurial process while also participating in that same very process: a game 
                    for the players, made by the players.

                <p>
                    Party on Wallstreet is a couch-party style game where a single host who owns the game can display it on a larger screen 
                    for other players to view. These other players can then connecting using their own computer or mobile device in order 
                    to interact with the game. During the game, the players will:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Invent solutions to randomly-generated problems</li>
                        <li>Choose an invention created by another player</li>
                        <li>Craft an enticing and persuasive pitch for their selected product</li>
                        <li>See their product pitches face-off against other players and vote on their favorite</li>
                        <li>Invest in products that have the most potential</li>
                        <li>Reap rewards in ROI from smart investments</li>
                    </ol>    
                </p>

            <div id="implementation" class="text-light">
                <h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    The current plan for the implementation of the game is to use WebSockets in order to implement the separate game instances so 
                    that multiple games can be played simultaneously. We intend to use Unity to create the game application itself, which will be run 
                    by the host of the game. We also intend to utilize our Barrett funding to outsource talent for the graphical design of the game. 
                    The majority of the game development will occur beginning in the Spring 2022 semester.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will likely not settle on a concrete business strategy until a prototype of the game exists. However, our prior 
                    surveying and research indicates that a game like this will sell best if priced at around $10-$20. We are also considering 
                    a free-trial program in order to help the game build velocity. 
                    As a brand new game studio, effective advertising will be essential to bringing this game to life. Our marketing strategy is still 
                    to be determined, but we anticipate that digital marketing, especially social media marketing, will be the most cost-effective way to 
                    reach our target market.
